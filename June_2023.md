6/5/23 - Added untitled NBA ML/Data Analysis project to Idea Farm*.

6/6/23 - [Sentify](https://github.com/afoshiok/Sentify) is finally ready for production, just need a quota approval from Spotify.

6/26/23 - Ran into an issue (EOF Error) when running the Sentify API in production. The deployment will probably not happen for now. But feel free to run it locally. :(  

6/26/23 - Decided to turn the Letterboxd project into a web app instead of a Discord bot.

**Idea Farm:* A Notion backlog of future project ideas I want to take on in the future.
